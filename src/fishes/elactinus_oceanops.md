## Introduction

Elactinus Oceanops, commonly known as the Blue Goby, is a mesmerizing addition to any nano reef tank. With its captivating blue color and peaceful temperament, this goby species adds vibrancy and liveliness to marine aquariums.

## Habitat and Behavior

Elactinus Oceanops is typically found in small groups within live corals in lagoons and sheltered coastal reefs at depths ranging from 1 to 15 meters. Notably, observations in Papua New Guinea reveal that these gobies prefer swimming around large coral heads on reef slopes, avoiding resting on corals as observed in Indonesia.

Maintain the following water parameters to ensure the well-being of Elactinus Oceanops:

- Temperature: 23.2째C - 30.3째C
- pH: 8.0 - 8.4

### Tank Size and Volume

An aquarium with a minimum capacity of 10 gallons is suitable for accommodating Elactinus Oceanops, making it an ideal choice for nano reef tanks.

## Breeding

Elactinus Oceanops requires small tubes or boreholes for shelter, preferably abandoned boreholes inhabited by bristle worms or mollusks. In an aquarium setting, providing small tubes from hardware stores is necessary. Place the tubes in the sand or secure them between stones to facilitate their natural behavior.

## Feeding

Elactinus Oceanops is an omnivorous species. It can be fed a varied diet, including:

- Artemia nauplii
- Bosmids (trunk crabs)
- Cyclops (copepods)
- Flake food
- Amphipods (amphipods, gammarus)
- Lobster eggs
- Mosquito larvae
- Mysis (suspended shrimps)
- Copepods (copepods)
