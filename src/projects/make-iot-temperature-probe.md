# Introduction

Maintaining an optimal temperature in your reef tank is crucial for the well-being of your aquatic ecosystem. In this project, we'll guide you through the steps to create an IoT temperature probe that not only monitors temperature changes in real-time but also alerts you if any irregularities occur. 

## Materials Required

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Temperature sensor (DS18B20)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Wi-Fi module
- Power source

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Setting up the ESP32

Begin by setting up the ESP32 microcontroller with the necessary firmware and software libraries to enable Wi-Fi connectivity and data transmission.

### Step 2: Integrating the Temperature Sensor

Connect the DS18B20 temperature sensor to the ESP32 and configure it to collect temperature data at regular intervals.

### Step 3: Establishing Connectivity

Configure the Wi-Fi module to enable the device to send temperature data to your preferred cloud service or home automation platform.

### Step 4: Implementing Alert Mechanisms

Set up an alert system that notifies you via your preferred communication channel if the temperature in the reef tank deviates from the optimal range.

# Conclusion

By following these steps, you can build an IoT temperature probe for your reef tank, ensuring that you can monitor temperature changes remotely and take timely action to maintain a stable environment for your aquatic life. Share your experience with us and let us know how this project benefited your reef tank maintenance routine.
