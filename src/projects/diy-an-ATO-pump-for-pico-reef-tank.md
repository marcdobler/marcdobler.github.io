Maintaining the water level in your pico reef tank is crucial for the health and stability of your delicate aquatic ecosystem. One way to ensure a stable water level is by setting up an Automatic Top Off (ATO) system. In this DIY guide, we will create an ATO pump for your pico reef tank using easily accessible materials.

## Materials Required

- Submersible pump
- Float switch
- Tubing
- Power adapter
- Silicone sealant
- Tape

## Step 1: Assemble the Pump

Start by attaching the tubing to the submersible pump. Ensure a secure connection to prevent any leakage.

## Step 2: Install the Float Switch

Position the float switch in the tank at a level where the water should be maintained. Connect the float switch to the pump using the tubing.

## Step 3: Secure the Wiring

Ensure that all wiring is safely routed and insulated to prevent any electrical hazards. Use tape to secure the wires in place.

## Step 4: Test the System

Fill the tank to a level slightly lower than the desired water level. Plug in the pump and check if the ATO system functions as expected. Make any necessary adjustments.

## Step 5: Finalize the Setup

Once you are satisfied with the functionality of the ATO pump, use silicone sealant to secure the tubing and wiring in place, preventing any accidental disconnections.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can create an effective ATO pump for your pico reef tank, ensuring a stable water level and creating a healthier environment for your aquatic life. Remember to regularly monitor and maintain the system to avoid any malfunctions.
