Well, well, well, look who it is! Marc, at your service.

So, what's the deal with me? I'll give you the scoop.

I'm your friendly neighborhood programmer, occasional code magician, and reluctant PHP aficionado, stuck in a love-hate relationship with technology. Ended up as the all-knowing CTO of a small-time French newspaper, fancy that!

But wait, there's more. Ever since my parents got me an aquarium at 15, I've been living and breathing the whole fishy world. And guess what? I'm still obsessed. I'm on a mission to create a super-smart, automated system to pamper my finned friends. Because, you know, fish deserve the royal treatment too.

Aside from my underwater escapades, I've got a thing for 3D printing. My Ender 3 is practically my sidekick, pumping out all kinds of nifty stuff. Need a little something printed? Consider it done. Oh, the joys of making a mess with melted plastic!

And hey, woodworking is my jam too. Magic Mirror, anyone? I whipped one up for my better half. Now, every morning, it's like a Disney movie in our corridor. Also, fun fact, I'm the DIY dad who's built an entire nursery's worth of furniture. Who needs IKEA, right?

Stay tuned for all the shenanigans and latest obsessions. Because, honestly, what's life without a little chaos and a whole lot of creativity? Welcome to the madness!
