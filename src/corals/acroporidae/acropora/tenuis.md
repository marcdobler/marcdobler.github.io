# Acropora Tenuis

Acropora Tenuis is a species of branching stony coral known for its fast growth and adaptability, found in various marine habitats. It is widely recognized for its vibrant colors and intricate branch structures.

## Appearance

Acropora Tenuis corals are characterized by the following features:

- **Growth Form:** Branching, with intricate, delicate structures and vibrant colors.
- **Coloration:** Varied, commonly appearing in shades of blue, brown, or green.
- **Polyps:** Small and numerous, with extended tentacles during feeding.

## Habitat

These corals are found in various marine environments, particularly widespread in the Indo-Pacific region. They thrive in areas with moderate water flow and abundant sunlight.

- **Water Conditions:** Acropora Tenuis thrives in well-maintained reef aquariums with stable water parameters. They require moderate to high lighting and moderate water movement.
- **Placement:** Provide ample space for their expansive growth and ensure they have access to direct light for optimal health.

## Feeding

Acropora Tenuis primarily feeds on microplankton, zooplankton, and dissolved organic matter present in the water column.

- **Feeding Regimen:** Offer small, particulate foods several times a week to supplement their nutritional requirements and promote healthy growth.

## Care Requirements

Maintaining stable water parameters is crucial for the well-being of Acropora Tenuis.

- **Water Parameters:**
  - Temperature: 74°F - 82°F (23°C - 28°C)
  - Salinity: 1.025 - 1.027
  - pH: 8.0 - 8.5
  - Alkalinity: 7 - 11 dKH
  - Calcium: 380 - 420 ppm
  - Magnesium: 1200 - 1350 ppm

- **Compatibility:** Due to their aggressive nature, keep them away from other corals to prevent overgrowth and damage to neighboring corals.

## Reproduction

Acropora Tenuis reproduces both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, while asexual reproduction occurs through fragmentation and budding.

## Conservation Status

Currently, Acropora Tenuis is not considered endangered. However, it is susceptible to the impacts of environmental changes, highlighting the importance of preserving natural marine ecosystems and practicing sustainable aquarium care.

For comprehensive information on Acropora Tenuis, consult reputable marine biology resources and trusted aquarium keeping guides.
