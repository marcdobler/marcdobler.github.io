# Acropora Nana

Acropora Nana is a species of small stony coral belonging to the genus Acropora, known for its compact and intricate branching structure. This species is highly valued in reef aquariums for its vibrant colors and delicate appearance.

## Appearance

Acropora Nana corals typically exhibit the following characteristics:

- **Corallites:** Small and compact, with intricate branching patterns that form dense colonies.
- **Coloration:** Vibrant shades of blue, pink, purple, and green, often with fluorescent tips.
- **Tentacles:** Extended during the night for feeding and can withdraw during the day.

## Habitat

This species is commonly found in shallow waters within the Indo-Pacific region, particularly in areas with moderate to high water flow and abundant sunlight.

- **Water Conditions:** Acropora Nana thrives in well-established reef aquariums with stable water parameters. They require strong, consistent water flow and high-intensity lighting.
- **Placement:** It is recommended to place them in the upper regions of the aquarium, ensuring they receive direct light and sufficient water movement.

## Feeding

As photosynthetic organisms, Acropora Nana primarily rely on the symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae. However, they can benefit from supplemental feeding.

- **Feeding Regimen:** Offer microplankton, zooplankton, or specially formulated coral foods a few times a week to enhance their overall health and coloration.

## Care Requirements

Maintaining a stable environment for Acropora Nana is crucial for its well-being.

- **Water Parameters:**
  - Temperature: 72°F - 78°F (22°C - 26°C)
  - Salinity: 1.024 - 1.026
  - pH: 8.1 - 8.4
  - Alkalinity: 8 - 12 dKH
  - Calcium: 400 - 450 ppm
  - Magnesium: 1250 - 1350 ppm

- **Compatibility:** Keep them away from aggressive or fast-growing corals to prevent overgrowth and aggressive behavior.

## Reproduction

Acropora Nana reproduces both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction occurs through the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, while asexual reproduction involves the budding of new polyps from the parent colony.

## Conservation Status

While not currently listed as endangered, Acropora Nana, like many coral species, is under threat from climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. Sustainable aquarium practices and the preservation of natural reef habitats are essential for the species' long-term survival.

For more detailed information on Acropora Nana, it is recommended to consult reputable marine biology resources and trusted aquarium keeping guides.
