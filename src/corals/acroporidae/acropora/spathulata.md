# Spathulata

Spathulata is a genus of corals known for their robust nature and distinctive appearance, found in various marine habitats. They are recognized for their large polyps and colonial growth forms.

## Appearance

Spathulata corals showcase the following features:

- **Growth Form:** Colonial, with large, fleshy polyps and a distinctive arrangement of corallites.
- **Coloration:** Various, commonly appearing in shades of brown, green, or cream.
- **Polyps:** Large and extended during feeding, often displaying a range of vivid colors.

## Habitat

These corals are commonly found in various marine environments, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, thriving in diverse conditions with moderate water flow and light.

- **Water Conditions:** Spathulata corals prefer well-maintained reef aquariums with stable water parameters. They require moderate lighting and moderate water movement.
- **Placement:** Provide adequate space for their colonial growth and ensure they have suitable lighting for optimal health.

## Feeding

Spathulata corals primarily feed on microplankton, zooplankton, and dissolved organic matter present in the water column.

- **Feeding Regimen:** Offer small, particulate foods several times a week to supplement their nutritional requirements and promote vibrant coloration.

## Care Requirements

Ensuring a stable environment is essential for the well-being of Spathulata corals.

- **Water Parameters:**
  - Temperature: 74°F - 80°F (23°C - 27°C)
  - Salinity: 1.025 - 1.027
  - pH: 8.0 - 8.4
  - Alkalinity: 7 - 11 dKH
  - Calcium: 380 - 420 ppm
  - Magnesium: 1200 - 1350 ppm

- **Compatibility:** They are generally peaceful but should be given ample space to prevent aggressive interactions with neighboring corals.

## Reproduction

Spathulata corals reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction involves the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, while asexual reproduction occurs through budding and fragmentation.

## Conservation Status

Currently, Spathulata corals are not considered endangered. However, they are susceptible to the impacts of environmental changes, emphasizing the importance of preserving natural marine ecosystems and practicing sustainable aquarium care.

For comprehensive information on Spathulata, consult reputable marine biology resources and trusted aquarium keeping guides.
