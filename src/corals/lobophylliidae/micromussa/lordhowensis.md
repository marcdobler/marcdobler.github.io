# Micromussa Lordhowensis

Micromussa Lordhowensis, commonly known as the "Acan Lord" or "Micromussa Lord," is a species of large-polyp stony coral (LPS) that belongs to the family Mussidae. This species is highly sought after in the marine aquarium trade for its vibrant colors and stunning appearance.

## Appearance

Micromussa Lordhowensis corals typically exhibit the following characteristics:

- **Polyps:** Large and fleshy, with a wide range of color variations including shades of red, green, blue, purple, orange, and combinations thereof.
- **Morphology:** Corallites are prominent and can have a smooth or subtly textured surface. They often have distinct walls separating individual polyps.
- **Tentacles:** Long, flowing tentacles, which can extend during nighttime or when the coral is feeding.

## Habitat

This species is native to the Indo-Pacific region, specifically found in the waters of Australia, including the Great Barrier Reef, as well as in various other regions across the Pacific Ocean.

- **Water Conditions:** Micromussa Lordhowensis thrives in well-established reef aquariums with stable water parameters. They prefer moderate to high lighting and moderate water flow.
- **Placement:** They are often placed in lower or middle parts of the aquarium, as they do not require extremely high light.

## Feeding

These corals are primarily photosynthetic, deriving much of their nutrition from the symbiotic zooxanthellae living within their tissues. However, they also benefit from supplemental feedings.

- **Feeding Regimen:** Offer small meaty foods, such as microplankton, zooplankton, or finely chopped seafood, a few times a week to ensure adequate nutrition.

## Care Requirements

Maintaining a healthy environment for Micromussa Lordhowensis involves careful attention to water quality and lighting.

- **Water Parameters:**
  - Temperature: 75°F - 80°F (24°C - 27°C)
  - Salinity: 1.023 - 1.025
  - pH: 8.1 - 8.4
  - Alkalinity: 8 - 12 dKH
  - Calcium: 400 - 450 ppm
  - Magnesium: 1250 - 1350 ppm

- **Compatibility:** While generally peaceful, they should be given adequate space to prevent aggressive interactions with neighboring corals. Maintain a safe distance from other corals with extended sweeper tentacles.

## Reproduction

Micromussa Lordhowensis can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction occurs through the release of eggs and sperm into the water column, where fertilization takes place. Asexual reproduction can occur through budding, where new polyps develop from the parent colony.

## Conservation Status

Due to the high demand for this species in the aquarium trade, populations of Micromussa Lordhowensis have experienced significant declines in the wild. As a result, they are listed as a species of concern, and sustainable collection practices are being encouraged to preserve wild populations.
