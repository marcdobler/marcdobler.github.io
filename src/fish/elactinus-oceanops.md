## Breeding

This pike slime fish needs small tubes or boreholes to live/feel good into which it can retreat, e.B abandoned boreholes inhabited by bristle worms or mollusks...

In the aquarium he will look for suitable holes...

If the aquarium does not have small holes, please provide small tubes for the necessary shelter (from the hardware store)!

Place the tubes in the sand or stick them between
stones.

## Feeding

Eats: Artemia nauplii, bosmids (trunk crabs), cyclops (copepods), flake food, amphipods (amphipods, gammarus), lobster eggs, mosquito larvae, mysis (suspended shrimps), copepods (copepods), saltwater fleas (cladocera), zooplankton (animal plankton)
