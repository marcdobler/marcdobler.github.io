## About me

Hi! I am Marc.

You may wonder what is going on here. Why do you need to hang on my site? Who am I?

Well, I am a programmer, a creator, a printer, and a person who does not like labels. Thus, let me tell you shortly what I am doing and why.

I loved programming since university when it became my profession, and then my job. By writing codes mainly on PHP, I became, with time, CTO of one small newspaper. French one. I’m from France, by the way. But it is located in Russia. I have lived in Russia for a long time. Now I live in Austria, Oh, big small world. But we’re not talking about that.

So, programming, yes. Not only PHP, other languages ​​too.
