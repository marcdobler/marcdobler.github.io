    <p>Hi! I'm Marc.</p>
<p>You may wonder what is going on here. And who I am.</p>
<p>Well, I am a programmer, a creator, a printer, and a person who does not like labels. Thus, let me tell you shortly what I am doing and why.</p>
<p>I loved programming since university when it became my profession, and then my job. By writing codes mainly on PHP, I became, with time, CTO of one small newspaper. French one. I'm from France, by the way.</p>
<p>So, programming. Not only PHP, I know some other languages ​​too.</p>
<p>Also, since childhood, I adore aquariums. At 15, my parents bought me one. And I &quot;got sick&quot; with it. I know a lot about fishes. I think I am a bit &quot;aspie,&quot; so, um ... I'm a little out of this world, with a touch of genius, ha-ha. In short, totally in love with the underwater world, at the age of 15, I learned almost by heart a thick aquarium book. Then I had a few more aquariums. And I began to think about what if I create an automated system for maintaining the desired state of water and feeding. I am still obsessed with this idea. I am developing a prototype.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if a cluttered desk is a sign of a cluttered mind, of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?<br>
-- <cite>Albert Einstein</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, everything at the junction of technology, electronics, and programming is about me. Therefore, another hobby of mine is 3D printing. I set up Ender 3 one myself, and now I print everything for the home and any other needs. Do you need help with yours? Or maybe want me to print something for you?</p>
<p>What else?... I also love wood. Have you heard about <a href="https://magicmirror.builders/">Magic Mirror</a>? I created and configured one for my wife. Hanging in the corridor, it pleases her every day, telling her how beautiful she is today. In dreams, I have the idea to make some wood furniture more for the house. I have already made a table for changing diapers for children (I have three kids if anyone is interested).</p>
<p>Here you can find a little bit about all this. So I told you what I am doing and answering the question of why. Well, I do something all the time, just because I can't do not do. Do something for nothing. Just like this. Welcome to my world!</p>
